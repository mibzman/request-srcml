* Could use some comments describing the rules for each if statement
* Is the variable language in request_language() needed? Just return.
* Messy indentation in generate_srcml() -2

Build and test results:
g++ -c request_srcml_t.cpp
g++ request_srcml_t.o request_srcml.o get_language_from_filename.o -o request_srcml_t
./get_language_from_filename_t
./request_srcml_t

My request_srcml_t.cpp file used for testing your code, along with several implementations of request_filename() and request_language(), can be found at:
